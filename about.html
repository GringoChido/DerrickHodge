            Derrick Hodge does not simply play music — he architects sonic worlds. A visionary composer, musical director, bandleader, producer, bassist and advocate, Hodge has orchestrated some of music's most iconic albums, pioneered breakthrough orchestral arrangements and compositions, scored a commanding catalogue of film and television work, and constructed evocative sonic installations for prestigious cultural institutions — all while championing the next generation of emerging young musicians.

            Two Grammys. Sundance Composer Fellow. Motif Award recipient. His foundational bassline on Common's <em>BE</em> has been officially enshrined as one of the Top 20 Basslines in Hip Hop History.
          </p>
          <p class="text-[15px] md:text-[17px] text-white60 leading-[1.7] mb-6 max-w-xl">
            Hodge describes his life's work as "speaking existence into possibility" — a philosophy that fuels every composition, every collaboration, every stage he commands. Driven by a devotion to music rather than genre, he is an architect defined only by his multiplicity. As celebrated a composer as he is revered as one of the great bassists and musicians of his generation, he has earned critical acclaim across genres and mediums while cultivating a diverse and devoted global audience.
          </p>
          <p class="text-[15px] md:text-[17px] text-white60 leading-[1.7] max-w-xl">
            Growing up just outside Philadelphia, Hodge's talent was quickly recognized by the luminaries of the city's neo-soul movement. While still in college, he anchored the sonic foundation for pioneers including Jill Scott, Maxwell, Floetry, Nas, Common, James Posyer and Musiq Soulchild — becoming the bass player and Musical Director who defined the movement's low end. Simultaneously, he was forging a parallel career in jazz circles alongside Terence Blanchard, Donald Byrd, Mulgrew Miller and Bootsie Barnes, while commanding a star position in his university's orchestra.

              Architected at the intersection of the concert hall and the cinema, Hodge's compositional voice is singular. His original orchestral works include <em>Mind of a Dreamer Suite</em> and <em>Infinite Reflections</em> — compositions that fuse hip-hop sensibility into symphonic structures with a fluency that has made him one of the most sought-after voices bridging both worlds.
            </p>
            <p class="text-[15px] md:text-[17px] text-white60 leading-[1.7] mb-6">
              He was commissioned by the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture to write the installation music for their permanent exhibit <em>The Power of Place</em>, exploring how Oak's Bluff became a place of collective imagining, struggle, achievement and freedom for a burgeoning African American community. He went on to compose for <em>Social Dance</em> and the <em>Making A Way</em> exhibit, paying tribute to the creativity, agency and resilience with which individual African Americans crafted opportunity in the face of racial oppression.
            </p>
            <p class="text-[15px] md:text-[17px] text-white60 leading-[1.7]">
              As a Blue Note Recording Artist, Hodge has released three critically acclaimed solo projects: <em>Live Today</em> (2013), <em>The Second</em> (2016), and <em>Color of Noize</em> (2020). His albums are rich, raw and revelatory — reflecting everything from his roots in the church to an undercurrent of hip-hop and eternal reverence for melody and classical composition.

              Anchored at the helm for a decade of musical direction for Maxwell (2009 &ndash; 2019), Hodge cemented his reputation as one of the most trusted musical directors in the business. His ability to translate an artist's vision into a cohesive live experience — commanding arrangements, band dynamics, and show flow — remains unmatched.

              Pioneered with purpose and championed with conviction — Hodge is a Motif Award recipient, one of the nation's highest honors for child advocacy. Throughout his life, he has devoted himself to projects that elevate and animate the African American legacy: the struggle but also — always — the poetry and the triumph too. It is this visionary ability to honor and advance both culture and people that is the principal thread weaving together Hodge's work.

              The Color of Noize project is Hodge's signature concept-series, bringing together contrasting sounds, styles and set-ups to create an immersive and inherently transcendent audio-visual experience. It is also particularly close to Hodge's heart as it opens up not just his music, but also his mission: to create a new, free space for music whilst also championing his community of both established and emerging musicians.

              More than an album, The Color of Noize is an ongoing commitment to artistic excellence and inclusion, in particular the creation of opportunities and broadening of horizons for inner city youth. He first premiered the project in 2019 as part of his Artist Residency at Monterey Jazz Festival, where he brought together a collection of musicians, some as young as 4, on stage with him to explore his original compositions.
