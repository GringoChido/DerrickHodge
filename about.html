            A prolific composer, musical director, bandleader, producer, bassist and advocate, Hodge has played on some of music's most iconic albums, written and performed breakthrough orchestral arrangements and compositions, scored an impressive catalogue of film and television work and created evocative sonic installations for prestigious cultural institutions, all alongside his work as an activist in the field of emerging young musicians.

            Two Grammys. Sundance Composer Fellow. Motif Award recipient. His playing on Common's <em>BE</em> has been officially recognized as one of the Top 20 Basslines in Hip Hop History.

          <p class="text-[15px] md:text-[17px] text-white60 leading-[1.7] mb-6 max-w-xl">
            Hodge describes his career as "speaking existence into possibility"; driven by a passion for music rather than genre, he is an artist defined only by his multiplicity. As lauded a composer as he is revered as one of the great bassists and musicians of his generation, he is critically acclaimed across genres and mediums and boasts a diverse and devoted global audience.
          </p>
          <p class="text-[15px] md:text-[17px] text-white60 leading-[1.7] max-w-xl">
            Growing up just outside Philadelphia, Hodge's talent was quickly recognised by the luminaries of the city's neo-soul movement, and whilst still in college he became the bass player and Musical Director of choice for pioneers including Jill Scott, Maxwell, Floetry, Nas, Common, James Posyer and Musiq Soulchild. Simultaneously he was forging a career in jazz circles with the likes of Terence Blanchard, Donald Byrd, Mulgrew Miller and Bootsie Barnes while also holding a star place in his university's orchestra.

              Hodge's compositional voice bridges the concert hall and the cinema. His original orchestral works include <em>Mind of a Dreamer Suite</em> and <em>Infinite Reflections</em>, pieces that weave hip-hop sensibility into symphonic structures with a fluency that has made him a sought-after voice in both worlds.

            <p class="text-[15px] md:text-[17px] text-white60 leading-[1.7] mb-6">
              He was commissioned by the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture to write the installation music for their permanent exhibit <em>The Power of Place</em>, exploring how Oak's Bluff became a place of collective imagining, struggle, achievement and freedom for a burgeoning African American community. He went on to compose for <em>Social Dance</em> and the <em>Making A Way</em> exhibit, paying tribute to the creativity, agency and resilience with which individual African Americans crafted opportunity in the face of racial oppression.

            <p class="text-[15px] md:text-[17px] text-white60 leading-[1.7]">
              As a Blue Note Recording Artist, Hodge has released three critically acclaimed solo projects: <em>Live Today</em> (2013), <em>The Second</em> (2016), and <em>Color of Noize</em> (2020). His albums are rich, raw and revelatory — reflecting everything from his roots in the church to an undercurrent of hip-hop and eternal reverence for melody and classical composition.

              A decade of musical direction for Maxwell (2009 &ndash; 2019) cemented Hodge's reputation as one of the most trusted musical directors in the business. His ability to translate an artist's vision into a cohesive live experience — from arrangements to band dynamics to show flow — is unmatched.

            <p class="text-[15px] md:text-[17px] text-white60 leading-[1.7]">
              Beyond Maxwell, Hodge has served as Musical Director for Jill Scott, Nas, Common, and other neo-soul and hip-hop pioneers. As a performer, he has founded and played in bands and groups as diverse and influential as R+R=Now, the Robert Glasper Experiment and The Blue Note All Stars, and as a producer he has collaborated with icons including Quincy Jones, Don Was and Common.

              Motif Award recipient — one of the nation's highest honors for child advocacy. Throughout his life, Hodge has devoted himself to projects that elevate and animate the African American legacy: the struggle but also — always — the poetry and the triumph too. It is this ability to honor and advance both culture and people that is the principle thread which weaves together Hodge's work.

              The Color of Noize project is Hodge's signature concept-series, bringing together contrasting sounds, styles and set-ups to create an immersive and inherently transcendent audio-visual experience. It is also particularly close to Hodge's heart as it opens up not just his music, but also his mission: to create a new, free space for music whilst also championing his community of both established and emerging musicians.
            </p>
            <p class="text-[15px] md:text-[17px] text-white60 leading-[1.7]">
              More than an album, The Color of Noize is an ongoing commitment to artistic excellence and inclusion, in particular the creation of opportunities and broadening of horizons for inner city youth. He first premiered the project in 2019 as part of his Artist Residency at Monterey Jazz Festival, where he brought together a collection of musicians, some as young as 4, on stage with him to explore his original compositions.
